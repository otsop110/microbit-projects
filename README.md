# BBC Micro:bit projects for Code Clubs

This is a collection of Micro:bit projects for 10-12 year old kids. I've found them  excellent for  coding workshops as they are entertaining and doable in 1.5 hours.

### Burglar Alarm

For this project you'll need the following:
* a BBC micro:bit, 
* a speaker (Piezo buzzer or headphones will do too)
* aluminum foil
* crocodile clips.



This fun project was inspired by this [MicroMonsters YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/igeUhVMqVRw).
