# BBC Micro:bit projects for Code Clubs

This is a collection of Micro:bit projects for 10-12 year old kids. I've found them  excellent for  coding workshops as they are entertaining and doable in 1.5 hours.

### Burglar Alarm

For the burglar alarm you'll need 
micro:bit, a speaker (Piezo buzzer or headphones will do too), aluminum foil, crocodile clips.

* First ordered list item.
* Another item.

This fun project was inspired by this MicroMonsters YouTube video
