# BBC Micro:bit projects for Code Clubs

This is a collection of Micro:bit projects for 10-12 year old kids. I've found them  excellent for  coding workshops as they are entertaining and doable in 1.5 hours.

### Burglar Alarm

For this project you'll need the following:
* a BBC micro:bit 
* a speaker (Piezo buzzer or headphones will do too)
* aluminum foil
* some crocodile clips.


Step-by-step instructions:
1. Stick a piece of aluminium foil on the top of the door and another on the door frame if you intend to secure yur room's entrance. If you'd like to set the alarm on your computer, jewelry box etc, attach the tin foils so that they'll touch when the lid is closed and separate when the box or laptop is opened.

2. Clip a crocodile clip on one foil (door frame, lid of the laptop or treasure box).

3. Attach another crocodile clip on another piece of foil (door, computer or treasure box).

4. Write your code in micro:bit editor. [Example code for burglar alarm](https://makecode.microbit.org/_9Y6P3fXEs88u).

5. Connect the micro:bit. Connect your alarm switch to PIN2 ( either the one on the or the door frame) and the other to GND.

6. Connect the speaker to PIN0 and GND.

7. Test the alarm.

#### Pseudo code

* When the two contacts stop being connected - when the circuit breaks - play sound of your liking and show an icon or text.
* Play it as long as the contacts are not connected.
* Disarm the alarm by pressing buttons A and B.
* Check first if the alarm is set. If not, set the alarm.
* Leave yourself time to exit the room.

This fun project was inspired by this [MicroMonsters YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/igeUhVMqVRw).


### Remote Control Micro:bot

This is en excellent playful hands-on activity that can be expanded to a Sumo bot fight. Build the bot body, code its movements and customize it with Lego or other accessories to make it more sturdy.

Bot bodies can be found from different providers. I've so far tested only the ones from [Techwillsaveus.com](https://www.techwillsaveus.com/shop/microbit-microbot-pack/).
